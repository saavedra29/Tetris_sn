    Tetris game written in python 2 and using Tkinter for graphics.
    It has two extra game modes for people with kinetic disabilities:

    * Paused mode (where the piece moves only when you press a key)
    * Change speed mode (where the speed can change manually)

    methods from and the algorithmic idea.
