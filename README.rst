Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

    Tetris game written in python 2 and using Tkinter for graphics.
    It has two extra game modes for people with kinetic disabilities:

    * Paused mode (where the piece moves only when you press a key)
    * Change speed mode (where the speed can change manually)

    Thanks to https://github.com/bsamek/Tetris where i got most of the
    methods from and the algorithmic idea.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * Tkinter
